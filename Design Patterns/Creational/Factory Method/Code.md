## Question
You are tasked with designing a document processing application that can export documents to various formats, such as PDF, DOCX, and HTML. Implement the Factory Method design pattern to create a DocumentExporter framework that allows for the creation of specific document exporter objects based on the desired output format. Provide a class diagram and explain how the Factory Method pattern supports the extensibility of the application for adding new document export formats.

In your response, describe the roles and responsibilities of each class involved in the Factory Method pattern and how it enables the application to handle different output formats with ease. Discuss how this design pattern allows for the addition of new document export formats without modifying existing code and any potential advantages or drawbacks of this approach.
