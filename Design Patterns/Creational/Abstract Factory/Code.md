## Question :
You are working on the development of a World War II-themed strategy game in the style of Hearts of Iron (HOI). The game involves multiple factions, each with distinct units, technologies, and strategies. Implement the Abstract Factory design pattern to create a FactionFactory system that allows for the creation of faction-specific units, technologies, and strategies. Provide a class diagram and describe how the Abstract Factory pattern enhances modularity and facilitates the addition of new factions to the game.

In your response, explain how the Abstract Factory pattern ensures that faction-specific content, such as units and technologies, can be created seamlessly while maintaining a high level of cohesion and minimizing code duplication. Discuss how this design pattern can simplify the addition of new factions to the game and how it promotes a clean and organized codebase for managing diverse gameplay elements in a World War II context within the HOI game.
