# Definiation :
An Abstract Factory is a design pattern in software engineering that helps you create families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes. 
In simpler terms, it's like a factory that produces different types of products, but instead of knowing exactly which product it's making, it follows a blueprint or a set of rules to create them.









# When to use :

### Multiple Related Product Families:
When your application needs to create families of related or interdependent objects, and you want to ensure that the products within each family are compatible with each other.

### Platform-Independent Code: 
When you want to write code that is independent of the underlying platform or implementation details. Abstract Factory allows you to encapsulate the creation of platform-specific objects in concrete factory classes.

### Product Variations: 
When your application may have different variations or configurations of the same set of objects. Abstract Factory allows you to define families of objects, and each concrete factory can provide a different variation.

### Consistency Across Products: 
When you want to enforce consistency in the products created by a factory. For example, in a graphical user interface (GUI) library, you might have different factories for creating buttons, text boxes, and checkboxes, and you want to ensure that these UI components have a consistent look and feel.
