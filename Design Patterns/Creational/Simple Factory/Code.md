## Question
You are developing a multimedia player application that can play different types of media files, including audio and video. Implement the Simple Factory design pattern to create a MediaPlayer class that can instantiate specific media player objects based on the type of media file (e.g., MP3 for audio, MP4 for video). Provide a class diagram and explain how the Simple Factory pattern simplifies the object creation process for different media types in your design.

In your answer, describe the roles and responsibilities of each class involved in the Simple Factory pattern and how it allows for easy extensibility when adding support for new media types in the future. Additionally, discuss any potential improvements or enhancements to this design pattern for handling additional features or formats.
