# Definiation :
An Abstract Factory is a design pattern in software engineering that helps you create families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes. 
In simpler terms, it's like a factory that produces different types of products, but instead of knowing exactly which product it's making, it follows a blueprint or a set of rules to create them.









# When to use :

### Multiple Related Product Families:
When your application needs to create families of related or interdependent objects, and you want to ensure that the products within each family are compatible with each other.





# Pitfalls :


### Performance Overhead: 
Depending on the language and implementation, there can be a slight performance overhead associated with using abstract factories, as they involve additional method calls and object instantiation.



# Real World :

### GUI Frameworks
