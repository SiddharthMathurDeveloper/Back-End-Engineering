## Question
You are designing a role-playing game (RPG) where players can customize their characters with various attributes, appearances, and equipment. To optimize character creation and improve gameplay, implement the Prototype design pattern to create a CharacterPrototype system. Explain how this pattern allows players to efficiently create and customize new characters while reducing object creation overhead. Provide a class diagram and describe the key classes and their responsibilities in your design.

In your response, discuss how the Prototype pattern enables players to clone existing character templates and modify them to suit their preferences, showcasing how it enhances gameplay and reduces resource consumption. Also, consider any potential use cases where the Prototype pattern might be extended or combined with other design patterns to further improve the gaming experience.
