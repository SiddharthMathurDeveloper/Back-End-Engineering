# Definiation :
***Prototype Method*** The Prototype pattern is a creational design pattern that deals with creating new objects by copying an existing object, known as a prototype. 
Instead of using constructors or factory methods to create new objects, the Prototype pattern allows you to create new objects by copying an existing object, known as a prototype.





# When to use :
### Object Initialization Overhead: 
When creating objects from scratch is expensive in terms of time or resources, and you want a more efficient way to create new objects that share common properties with existing objects.


### Complex Object Creation:
When creating an object involves complex initialization, configuration, or setup that you want to reuse for other objects without duplicating the code.


### Variations of Objects: 
When you need to create multiple variations of an object, each with slight differences, and you want to avoid the effort of manually configuring each new instance.


### Resource Sharing : 
When you want to share or pool resources, such as database connections, threads, or cached data, to improve performance and reduce resource consumption.


### Immutable Objects: 
When you're working with immutable objects and want to create new instances with modifications based on existing instances (a common pattern in functional programming

### Dynamic Object Creation: 
When you want to support dynamic object creation at runtime, allowing users or configuration settings to determine which objects to create.


### Configurable Objects: 
When you need to create objects with various configurations, and you want to easily switch between configurations by cloning a prototype and adjusting the settings.


### Reducing Subclass Proliferation: 
When you want to avoid creating numerous subclasses to represent variations of an object. Instead, you can create prototypes and clone them as needed

### Implementing a Copy-on-Write Strategy: 
In scenarios where you want to optimize for read-heavy operations and minimize copying until a write operation occurs, the Prototype pattern can be helpful.



***Remember that the Prototype pattern allows you to create new objects by copying existing ones, saving time and resources. However, it's important to ensure that the prototype object is in a consistent and valid state before cloning it. Additionally, not all objects are suitable for cloning, especially if they have complex internal dependencies or external resources that cannot be easily duplicated.***
