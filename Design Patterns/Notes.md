 - 3 Types of Patterns:
    - Creational
    - Structural
    - Behavioral

## Creational Patterns :

<br/>
- All the Design Patterns that belong to this group that `deal with creating objects from classes`,
  
- They will give you solutions to common problems that you will face when you're thinking about creating objects from your 
  existing classes.


## Structural Patterns :

<br/>

- So these Design Pattern `deal with how we create or compose Objects` so we can add another object to our existing object and then that way we can have a composition.
  
- So these Design Pattern deal with how to arrange our classes and objects so that we can derive a functionality out of that.


## Behavioral Patterns :

<br/>

- So these design veterans `deal with how classes and objects interact or communicate with each other` 

- How we can design the interaction between groups of objects so that we can derive a functionality or we can achieve the desired 
   goal with these objects.
